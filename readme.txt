Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP.

== Description ==

Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP.

This includes E_ALL so might contain many more errors than you might expect.

This is useful for finding and debugging issues during development, but could easily break your markup, and is not for users who are not editing code directly.
Requires jQuery to be included with your theme.

== Installation ==

Upload the development-debug-backtraces.php file to the plugin directory. Ensure jQuery is being included with your theme.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
* Initial Release
