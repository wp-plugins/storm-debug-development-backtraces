Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP.

== Description ==

Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP, in addition to the standard error outputs configured for your PHP installation.

This includes E_ALL so might contain many more errors than you might expect.

This is useful for finding and debugging issues during development, but could easily break your markup, and is not for users who are not editing code directly.
Requires jQuery to be included with your theme.

== Installation ==

Upload the development-debug-backtraces.php file to the plugin directory. Ensure jQuery is being included with your theme.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2.1 =
* Add GPLv2 license properly
* Rename plugin to something a little less corporate ;)
* Disable backtraces for E_STRICT error types, as even wordpress generates a few of these in released code. The next release will allow you to customise what error types to display backtraces for.

= 0.1 =
* Initial Release
