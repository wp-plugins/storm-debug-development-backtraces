Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP.

== Description ==

Display debug backtraces for every error generated by PHP.

This includes E_STRICT and E_ALL so contains many more errors than you might expect.

This is useful for finding and debugging issues during development, but could easily break your markup, and is not for users who are not editing code directly.
Requires jQuery to be included with your theme.

== Installation ==

Upload the storm-debug-backtraces.php file to the plug directory. Ensure jQuery is being included with your theme.
